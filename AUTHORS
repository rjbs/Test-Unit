# PerlUnit was originally written as a port of Kent Beck and Erich
# Gamma's xUnit testing framework by Christian Lemburg and Brian
# Ewins, and is now maintained by Adam Spiers and the rest of the
# PerlUnit team. 
#
# The following is an alphabetical list of all the people who've
# contributed code and effort to making PerlUnit what it is today.
# Where possible we have included their Sourceforge usernames and
# preferred email addresses.
#
# The use of this database for anything other than PerlUnit
# development is strictly forbidden. (Passive distribution with the
# PerlUnit source code package is naturally allowed)

As far as copyright years go (as if anyone cares), this may serve as a
vague starting guide for who put together the bulk of the project:

 2000 ba22a, clemburg
 2001 clemburg, pdcawley
 2002 adamspiers, pdcawley

Where specific files in the project have been contributed by one
person and that person has claimed the copyright, I have left their
authorship.

The rest of the files have moved over to a more boilerplate style
crediting the PerlUnit Development Team and referring to the
Test::Unit docs and this file.  This is simply for maintenance sanity.
