NAME
    Test::Unit::* - a unit testing framework for Perl

DESCRIPTION

    Test::Unit::* is a sophisticated unit testing framework for Perl
    that is derived from the JUnit testing framework for Java by Kent
    Beck and Erich Gamma.

    While this framework is originally intended to support unit
    testing in an object-oriented development paradigm (with support
    for inheritance of tests etc.), Test::Unit::Procedural is intended
    to provide a simpler interface to the framework that is more
    suitable for use in a scripting style environment.

    Therefore, Test::Unit::Procedural does not provide much support
    for an object-oriented approach to unit testing - if you want
    that, please have a look at Test::Unit::TestCase (also included in
    this install).

    A short tutorial on the object-oriented approach can be found in
    the documentation of Test::Unit::TestCase (the test base class).
    The Test::Unit self-test suite (contained in t/tlib) is a good
    example of this approach.

    There is also a GUI based interface to the testing framework.
    The "TkTestRunner.pl" script shows how to invoke it.

    The testing framework also features adapters for tests in the
    Test::Harness style to tests in the unit testing framework style
    and vice versa - see Test::Unit::HarnessUnit and
    Test::Unit::UnitHarness.  An example of this approach is the
    self-test of the unit testing framework that you start with the
    'make test' command (see t/all_tests.t).

PREREQUISITES
    Class::Inner, Devel::Symdump and Error.pm are required.  A new-ish
    version of base.pm (> 1.0) is required to avoid the problem where
    earlier versions failed to compile in the parent class.  The Tk
    module is needed for the GUI.

INSTALLATION
    Once you have installed the prerequisites, just perform the usual
    incantation (replacing 'x.yy' with the current version):

    gunzip Test-Unit-x.yy.tar.gz
    tar -xvf Test-Unit-x.yy.tar 
    cd Test-Unit-x.yy
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
