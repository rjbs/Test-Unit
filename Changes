Revision history for Perl extension Test::Unit.

0.14    - lots of changes and additions:
          Piers Cawley fixed a bad bug that caused inherited tests to 
	  be called on the parent class instead of the inheriting class.
          Piers Cawley also put in a lot of new functionality for regular
	  expression assertions and coderef assertions.
	  Matthew Astley fixed the POD documentation.
	  Matthew Astley and Adam Spiers fixed a number of smaller things.
	  Greatly improved formatting of failure reports.
	  Version number is now (hopefully) handled correctly for CPAN.
	  Kevin Connor ported Setup and TestDecorator to Perl.

0.13    - patched the patch from 0.12, added patches by David Esposito,
          (documentation for optional message arg to assert(), make
	  TkTestRunner use to_string() for exception display), added
	  documentation on problems in using assert() with regexes and 
	  messages, fixed these problems for the procedural style
	  interface (where they can be solved) 

0.12    - added patch by Matthew Astley (method to quell backtrace on 
          failed tests, see Test::Unit::TestCase).
